# 🍷 Wine Quality Prediction using Ensemble Models

This machine learning project predicts wine quality using physicochemical properties from the UCI Wine Dataset. It includes data cleaning, EDA, ensemble modeling (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost), hyperparameter tuning, and Streamlit deployment.

## 📊 Tools Used
- Python, pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, seaborn
- scikit-learn, xgboost
- Streamlit for deployment
- GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning

## 🚀 Features
- Data Preprocessing & EDA
- Ensemble Model Training
- Accuracy: ~85% with VotingClassifier
- Streamlit app for live prediction

## ▶ Run the App
```bash
streamlit run app.py
